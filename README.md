# Time Tracker

## Goals
A simple time-tracker that makes it easy to track time spent on different projects. You should be able to:

- [ ] Sign in with account to display information
- [ ] Create, edit and delete activities
- [ ] Create, edit and delete projects
- [ ] Display diagram overview of what time was spent on what project during the week
- [ ] Display table with the last 20 entries
- [ ] Display monthly overview of each project
- [ ] Export monthly project overviews as a .csv file


## Frameworks
I will be using React (with Redux) for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. I will most likely use MongoDB for the database.
